These tasks may involve query handling, calculations, record maintenance, transaction entries, etc. RPA can be applied for the automation of rules-based, repetitive, data-heavy, and high compliance tasks where structured data and clear predefined rules and parameters are used. The solutions are easily and quickly designed, tested and implemented. They are designed to require a relatively low investment or expenditure.","imagePath":"rpa.svg"}],"cards":[{"header":"How does it work?","description":"Using UiPath is basically equal to adopting robots that automate tasks that are repetitive and manual-rules-based.
